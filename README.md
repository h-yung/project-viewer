# project-viewer

A gallery for full-screen viewing of panoramic(?) photos, photos not included. Password protection can be configured.

Further click throughs etc. TBC.

Typescript + react + Ant Design

Provides for:

-   adjusting ratio to avoid blank trailing ends without the more precise calculation of individual slide cuts

Needs:

-   arrow /keyboard nav (... that ref issue)

Why...

-   Is it not getting images from some database instead?
    -   The bother of free hosting for a full-stack app when Netlify is highly convenient for static websites. Someday might change to this route and use current gallery interface as a schema.
